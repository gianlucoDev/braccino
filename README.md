## Dependencies

Install dependencies with `pipenv install`,
to also install development dependecies use `pipenv install --dev`.

NOTE: create a `.venv` folder inside the project before installing dependencies,
pipenv will use that folder to create the virtual environment.
This is necessary because vscode will look inside that folder to find the Python executable.
